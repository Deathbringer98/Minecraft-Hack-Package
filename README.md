A Minecraft hack package comments explaining code

# SpeedHack Class:
This class is responsible for manipulating the player's speed within predefined limits. It randomly alters the speed slightly to make the changes less noticeable while ensuring it stays within a safe range between a defined maximum and minimum speed.
# AutoTarget Class:
This class simulates the ability to automatically target the nearest entity, such as another player or a mob, within the game. The current implementation is simplistic, targeting the first entity provided in a list.
# AutoAttack Class:
The AutoAttack class enables the simulation of attacking a targeted entity. It includes a method that outputs a message indicating an attack on the entity, serving as a placeholder for more complex game logic.
# Entity Class:
This small utility class represents a game entity with basic attributes, such as a name. It's used by the AutoTarget and AutoAttack classes to demonstrate interactions with game entities.
# XRay Class:
The XRay class demonstrates a potential feature where players could see hidden underground resources, like minerals and chests. It includes a mock method that, in a real scenario, would reveal these hidden items by interfacing with the game's world data.
